                Humans communicate and live their whole lives because they are
                social animals. It is necessary to live by matching the
                conflicts that arise in the process with dialogue</span

              Also, the characteristics of happy families have something in
              common that they don't get angry easily. There are times when I
              don't know the importance of family because they are always next
              to me and get angry more easily. It will be necessary not to take
              it for granted that you have a family next to you, but to cherish
              and act more.
