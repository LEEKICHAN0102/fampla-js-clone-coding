                Humans communicate and live their whole lives because they are
                social animals. It is necessary to live by matching the

              Also, the characteristics of happy families have something in
              common that they don't get angry easily. There are times when I
              don't know the importance of family because they are always next
              to me and get angry more easily. It will be necessary not to take
              it for granted that you have a family next to you, but to cherish
              and act more.
